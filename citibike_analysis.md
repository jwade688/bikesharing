# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
This is a summary of the analytic work that I did with the NYC Citi Bike data.

## Des Moines Citi Bike Dashboard

## Analysis
The goal is to introduce a Citi Bike model to the Des Moines metropolitan area. First we would need to scale the model as New York City has over 8.3 million people compared to Des Moines' 214 thousand. Des Moines is also a less dense city compared to NYC. Proportionally there will be less need for bikes, but all this can be successfully scaled. From the Citi Bike data, we see that bikes are most popular with users born after 1995. This could be important in Des Moines since 24.5% of the population is under 18 (compared to NYC, 20.9%). Des Moines is a significantly smaller city too. This could lend to popularity in the bike program.

I put together thoughts on ideal bike placement within Des Moines. When looking at the NYC data, the most popular places to start a bike trip is similar to where NYC McDonalds are located. I mapped the McDonald locations in Des Moines and it proved to be valuable information on possible starting locations for bikes as well. Another thought from the starting trips in NYC was that popular locations were often in Tourist locations, so using the Catch Des Moines tourist site map, I pull their spots of interest as other ideal starting stops for bike trips.

Finally, I thought it was important to put together some information on the wear and tear of bikes. It appears that with the large number of bikes, wear and tear is spread evenly which will help the bikes last longer. Obviously there will be some outliers that need more attention than the rest.
